## **🛠️ Getting Started**

Before our first class, please set up your coding environment. You have a few options:

1. **Install Python:** Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
2. **Choose a Code Editor:**  
   * **VS Code:** A powerful, free code editor. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).  
   * **Jupyter Notebook:** Great for interactive coding. You can install it by running pip install notebook in your terminal.  
   * **Replit:** A browser-based IDE that requires no installation. Visit [Replit](https://replit.com/) and create an account.
